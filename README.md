# Welcome to GitHub Users Viewer

This is a simple app that allows you to search for GitHub users and view their profiles. It was built with [Expo](https://expo.dev/), a platform for universal React applications.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   yarn
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

3. Use ExpoGo to view the app on your phone

   - [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/expo-go/id982107779)
   - [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent)

   ## Troubleshooting

   Sometimes hot reloading doesn't work as expected. If you encounter any issues, try restarting the app and clearing the cache.

   ```bash
   yarn start-clear
   ```

## Possible improvements

- Add assets such as images and icons
- Animations and transitions may sometimes be janky. It should be refactored and optimized
- Refactor queries to use a more efficient method of fetching data
- Add more detailed error handling and user feedback
- Check the UI/UX for accessibility and usability
- Test the UI scaling on different devices and orientations
- Add tests for components and hooks
- Refactor the codebase to make it more readable and maintainable
